## About The Project

The Hospital Management Django project is designed to streamline the interaction between doctors and patients. Doctors have the capability to upload blogs or save them as drafts, allowing them to share valuable medical information and insights. Additionally, the system enables doctors to manage appointments by checking, accepting, or canceling them. This ensures efficient scheduling and communication between healthcare providers and patients.

For patients, the project offers a user-friendly interface for registration and login. Once logged in, patients can access the blog section to read and comment on doctors' posts. The appointment booking feature allows patients to choose a specific doctor based on filters and schedule appointments. Patients can also view their past appointments, creating a comprehensive and accessible record of their medical history. Overall, this Hospital Management system enhances communication and accessibility in the healthcare process for both doctors and patients.
